# Prog 4: CryptoFile
3/2 Additional explanation added on 3/2, shown in green. Specific filenames are now required.
3/8 Changed which files are used, both for cipher.txt as well as changed huck.txt to lifeonmiss.txt.  These changes shown highlighted in red.  Your decoding with this combination will work much better, except characters F,G and J,X will still be mixed up. I have provided sample output below with these particular files, so you can check your work.  I added an extra credit option, and extended the deadline by 3 days.

The cipher.txt file has been encrypted by doing letter substitution.  In other words, every time a particular letter occurred in the entire file (upper or lower case), a different character was substituted for it instead.  Spaces and punctuation were left alone, only modifying the alphabetic characters.  (See this sample program to illustrate how to count characters from an input file.)
